			“Children are happier when healthy”. Dronias Hope Ministries makes every effort to ensure that children and the elderly beneficiaries receive proper and required medical attention timely so as to achieve the dignified joy that every person is worthy of.
		</p>
		<p>
			We do medical camps to reach out to the children in villages who maybe suffering from various diseases such as; Malaria, Marasmus, Kwashiorkor, cough and flu among others. We educate the care takers of these children on ways of how to prevent children from contracting such as diseases through encouraging and supporting proper feeding. 
		</p>
		<p>
			To the elderly, we majorly focus on diabetes, blood pressure, HIV/AIDS, cancer among others, some of which are unheard of. These underprivileged people certainly think that the chronicle diseases they suffer are out of witchcaraft or misfortune. We extend medication and do a follow up to ensure that they hope and joy is kept burning and that they longer happier and descent lives.

			Dronias Hope Ministries, through its Health Program, intends to extends various equipment and materials needed to assist various groups such as Mama Kits, for expectant mothers, mosquito nets, Sanitary Pads to girls, Hospital equipment to the local Health Facilities among others.
