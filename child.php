		<h2>Child Protection</h2>
		<p>
			Dronias Hope Ministries strives to fight for the rights of the vulnerable and street children in the outcasts of the country. These children deserve to be loved and directed as it is not easy to be “a child without a family.” 
		</p>
		<p>
			Our major goals is to ensure that the children we reach out to have access to basic needs; clothing, descent and safe housing, clean water, health services as well as physical and formal education.
		</p>
		<p>
			We endeavour to re integrate the children into family life through re uniting them to their families, adoption or incorporating them into Jupat Children’s home, basing on their moral and material needs.
		</p>
		<p>
			Some children have been victims of domestic violence as well as sexual harassment. As Jupat Family, we reach out to them and extend love, moral and medical support to these children ensuring that they find a home and hope with us.
