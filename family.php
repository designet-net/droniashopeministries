		<h2>Family Support</h2>
		<p>
			Many families have suffered great trauma after loss of their homes due to either land conflicts, natural calamities such as floods, or unspeakable poverty which makes the victims to sell off their only property (home) hoping to make a better life. The children who belong to these families can hardly acquire formal education and other basic needs, such as clothing, food, medication and sometimes accommodation and thus end up on the streets where life is much more traumatising.
		</p>
		<p>
			Through the family Help Programme, Dronias Hope Ministries renews the hope of such families by helping them get back to their feet. We construct a simple and descent home for the victims, help them acquire skills to be able earn a sustainable living and give them the basic needs to help them set off to a more descent and joyous life. We follow up on our beneficiaries, and thanks to your Support and Godâ€™s help, these families have all kept thriving. We hope to extend this joy to more families out there that are struggling.
