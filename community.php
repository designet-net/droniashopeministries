		<h2>Community Empowerment</h2>
		<p>
			Dronias Hope Ministries, through volunteers and donations, organises and offers skills training programmes to various categories of people, women, youths, people with disabilities, after identifying their needs. This is intended to ensure that the community has people who can earn a sustainable income with the hands on skills even though they might not have acquired formal education.
		</p>
		<p>
			The hands on skills we train the beneficiaries include among others, hair dressing, tailoring, soap and detergent making, small scale commercial farming.
		</p>
		<p>
			We intend to construct a vocational training centre that will be training the less privileged groups and equipping them with skills that are competitive and sustainable on the market.
		</p>
		<p>
			We also intend to provide social services to communities such as putting up health facilities, community Schools. 
		</p>
		<p>
			We have constructed boreholes and modern wells to extend clean and safe water to the rural community that were collecting water from sources which were at the same time used by the animals for feeding. Thanks to your Support!!
